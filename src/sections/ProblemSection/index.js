              The Language Barrier
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1">
              In over 3,700 publicly listed companies in Japan, less than 20% of
              them publish financial results and management guidance in English.
              For small and mid-cap companies, this ratio is even lower. Without
              fluency in Japanese, overseas investors cannot directly understand
              the performance of these companies and must rely on large
              sell-side firms with expertise in Japan.

              Sparse Sell-Side Coverage
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1">
              Of over 3,700 publicly listed companies in Japan, approximately
              600 companies are not followed by any sell side firm, and
              approximately 1,400 companies are tracked by only a single sell
              side analyst. Furthermore, sell side reports in English are even
              rarer. As a result, overseas investors cannot include these
              companies in their investment universe even if they are an
              interesting alpha-generating opportunity.

            <Typography variant="body1">
              Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), a recent
              European regulation, is reshaping the way equity research is
              distributed and consumed in Europe and in other markets. This
              regulation is anticipated to cause a downward pressure on the
              number of companies covered by existing sell side firms. Japan and
              Asia-Pacific markets will not be insulated from the impact of
              MiFID II, which will further reduce coverage of these markets by
              existing sell-side firms going forward.
